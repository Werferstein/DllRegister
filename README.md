# DllRegister

DllRegister is a tool for easy registration of DotNet com Dlls. The Windows command line tool Regasm.exe does not give any meaningful information whether a registration was successful.

The program tests the necessary entries in the registry and tries to correct errors if necessary. All steps are saved as a log and can be restored. Complex registrations can be saved and loaded as XML file.
